[WORK IN PROGRESS as of Sept 10 2016]

A collection of interesting and memorable projects developed for and during my master's degree at JHU

### Basic Fish Classifier

A comparison of the Euclidean distance, Mahalanobis distance, and Naive Bayes classifiers is done. There are l=7 features, and N=160 exemplars. ML estimator is used when calculating mean vectors and covariance matrices of the classes under a Gaussian distribution assumption. 

### PowerBall Analysis (personal mini-project)

Historical data is used in an attempt to determine whether ball numbers drawn in the lottery follow a uniform distribution. Any reasonable person would know what to do if they DO NOT follow a uniform distro. Complicating the analysis is the fact that the range of values have changed throughout the years, and thus, relatively few data points are available.

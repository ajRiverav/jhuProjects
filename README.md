[WORK IN PROGRESS as of Sept 10 2016]

A collection of interesting, memorable, and..well, mundane projects developed for and during my master's degree at JHU

### [Basic Fish Classifier](https://github.com/ajRiverav/jhuProjects/tree/master/Basic%20Fish%20Classifier)

A comparison of the Euclidean distance, Mahalanobis distance, and Naive Bayes classifiers is done. There are l=7 features, and N=160 exemplars. ML estimator is used when calculating mean vectors and covariance matrices of the classes under a Gaussian distribution assumption. 

### [PowerBall Analysis](https://github.com/ajRiverav/jhuProjects/tree/master/PowerBall%20Analysis) (a personal mini-project)

Historical data is used in an attempt to determine whether ball numbers drawn in the lottery follow a uniform distribution. Any reasonable person would know what to do if they DO NOT follow a uniform distro (i.e. contact the lottery people, right?). Complicating the analysis is the fact that the range of values have changed throughout the years, and thus, relatively few data points are available. 

### [MLE vs MoM estimator](https://github.com/ajRiverav/jhuProjects/tree/master/MLE%20vs%20MoM%20estimator)

Two estimatation methods (maximum likelihood and Method of moments) are compared at estimating a paramater of a uniformly distributed random variable.

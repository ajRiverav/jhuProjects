# To bike or not to bike? Correlations between Capital Bikeshare ridership and weather events.

In this analysis, we explore and explain the effect of weather events in the D.C. Metropolitan area on the number of bike rentals. This effort was possible thanks to "open data" stance at Capital Bikeshare and WeatherUnderground.com. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two phase:
    a) EDA phase of project (Exploratory Data Analysis)
    b) "Infographic" phase

To reproduce our EDA, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have all 2012 and 2013 csv files found at 
https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/trip-history-data

2. Run Project_EDA_BikeDataReader.ipynb to process the Capital Bikeshare files

3. Run Project_EDA_wxDataReaderHourlyData.ipynb to get the weather data

To run the analysis on a Jupiter notebook:
4. Run Project_EDA_Main.ipynb

An infographic with a summary of the analysis can be seen in infographic.pdf
5. The raw plots used for the infographic are found in InfographicRawPlots.ipynb
